0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget:
	void _puts_recursion(char *s);
	function that prints a string, then prints a new line

1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together:
	Prototype: void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);
	function that prints a string in reverse

2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange
	Prototype: int _strlen_recursion(char *s);
	function that returns the length of a string

3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling
	Prototype: int factorial(int n);
	a function that returns the facorial of a number

4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate
	Prototype: int _pow_recursion(int x, int y);
	a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y

5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer
	Prototype: int _sqrt_recursion(int n);
	a function that returns the natural square root of a number

6. Inception. Is it possible?
	Prototype: int is_prime_number(int n);
	a function that returns 1, if the input integeris a prime number, otherwise return 0

7. They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything
	Prototype: int is_palindrome(char *s);
	a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not

8. Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...
	Prototype: int wildcmp(char *s1, char *s2);
	a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if it can be considered identical, otherwise return 0
